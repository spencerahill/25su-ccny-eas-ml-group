# Experiment: Baseline Reality Check

**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Hypothesis**: Neural network should significantly outperform simple temperature-based rules

**Parameters**: 
- Learning rate: 0.01 (default)
- Epochs: 50
- Architecture: Simple feedforward (1 → 32 → 3)
- Baseline: Temperature percentiles (25th/75th)

**Results**:
- **Temperature Baseline**: 75.6% accuracy
- **ML Model**: 75.7% accuracy  
- **ML Improvement**: +0.1 percentage points (0.1% relative improvement)

**Baseline Method**:
- Winter: < 40.0°F (25th percentile)
- Summer: > 69.5°F (75th percentile) 
- Spring/Fall: 40.0°F - 69.5°F (middle 50%)

**Shocking Observations**:
- Simple temperature thresholds are essentially equivalent to neural network!
- Domain knowledge baseline captures the underlying pattern perfectly
- 150+ years of weather data, complex ML pipeline → gains almost nothing over percentiles

**Key Learning**:
This is a **perfect pedagogical example** showing:
1. ML isn't always the answer
2. Simple baselines can be surprisingly strong
3. Always establish meaningful baselines before celebrating ML results
4. Domain knowledge often beats algorithmic complexity

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate why ML provides so little benefit
- Try more complex architectures or features
- Explore whether problem is too simple or data too clean
- Consider alternative problem formulations
