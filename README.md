# 25su-ccny-eas-ml-group
Repo for summer 2025 CCNY EAS machine learning working group

## Overview
We are spending the summer trying to create simple ML models applied to a problem relevant to our broader research.  The emphasis is on learning how ML models work, both the underlying concepts to a certain degree and even more so the practical nuts-and-bolts of running them.  We are mostly using pytorch.

## Contents:
- `docs`: notes from weekly meetings; example files; informal guides on various ML-related topics
- `projects`: materials from individual group member's projects
  - `nielsen-handwriting-nn`: implementation of the handwritten digit recognition model from [Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
